# BombSweeper
Simple game I programmed in MIPS for my Computer Organization final project :)

In my take on Minesweeper, titled BombSweeper, a grid full of empty cells is displayed to the user, there are bombs hidden in random cells across the board. The user
must select cells (by entering in the x,y coordinates of the cell) to clear them from the board, if there is a mine in that cell, the user loses a life (the user has 3
lives). To win you must clear all the squares without bombs off of the board, you lose by hitting more than 3 bombs. Upon win or loss the user will be prompted to play
again .
